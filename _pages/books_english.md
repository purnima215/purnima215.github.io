  <h2 class="archive__item-title">Bandaged Moments: Stories of Mental Health by Women Writers from Indian Languages</h2>
  <p class="archive__item-excerpt">
      Bandaged Moments brings together 26 compelling stories from 17 Indian
    languages, humanising psychological conditions through storytelling,
    with each narrative illustrating the multifaceted nature of mental
    health issues, the challenges of seeking psychiatric help in India,
    along with the redemptive power of a support system (or the consequences
    when there isn’t one), and the lived experiences of individuals grappling
    with mental health issues in varied cultural settings.
